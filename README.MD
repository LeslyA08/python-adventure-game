Python Project
This project consists of making a 'choose your own adventure' text based story/game that executes in the console.
Requirements:
- Classes (at least one, but if you want to get fancy and can work in inheritance, feel free)
- Functions
- Control flow (if/elif/else)
- Logging the decisions to log files or to csv (or both) <- the rest is flexible, but this is necessary
